[lshw][lshw] (Hardware Lister) XML Parser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alessandroleite/lshw-xml-parser.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alessandroleite/lshw-xml-parser)
===================

What is it?
------------

A XML parser for the [lshw][lshw] output.

How to use it?
------------

1. ##### Maven Repository

	See instructions in [Maven Repository](https://github.com/alessandroleite/maven-repository)


2. ##### Usage


	a) Parsing a XML returned by the lshw command.


		Nodes nodes = lshw.parser.xml.Lshw.unmarshall("lshw-output-hardware-description.xml");
	
	Now, we can iterate through the nodes:
	
		for (NodeInfo node: nodes)
		{ 
			System.out.println(node);
		}

	Or we can find a node by its id.

		NodeInfo node = nodes.findNodeByHardwareId("1");

	b) Generating a XML

   		lshw.parser.xml.Lshw.marshall(new NodeInfo("hardware 1"), new NodeInfo("hardware 2"), ...);
   		

	or
	
		lshw.parser.xml.Lshw.marshall(new Nodes());
		

	See the JUnit's class: lshw.types.jaxb.test.JaxbXmlParserTest
